#
# Listing of all CSEIS modules to be included in executable
# The order in which the modules appear is of no importance
# Listing of modules:
#  <module name>  <SINGLE | MULTI | INPUT>  [version number]
# The version number is optional. When specified, the version number needs to have one decimal place, such as 1.0 or 1.2
# 
# To auto-generate C++ style header files, use prepare_cseis_build.sh
#
# In order to use a new module in Seaseis it is not required to list it in this text file.
# Including a module in this list will include this module in the auto-generated HTML help page:
#       seaseis -html
# It also makes it easier to access the online help from the command line:
#       seaseis <module_name>
# If not listed here, the module's online help can still be accessed but the module version has to be specified:
#       seaseis <module_name> <version>   (Example: "seaseis new_module 1.0")
#
# While the above is true for Linux, for Windows it IS currently required to list all modules to make them available in Seaseis.
